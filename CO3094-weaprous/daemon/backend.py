daemon.backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a backend object to manage and persist backend daemon. 
It implements a basic backend server using Python's socket and threading libraries.
It supports handling multiple client connections concurrently and routing requests using a
custom HTTP adapter.

Requirements:
--------------
- socket: provide socket networking interface.
- threading: Enables concurrent client handling via threads.
- response: response utilities.
- httpadapter: the class for handling HTTP requests.
- CaseInsensitiveDict: provides dictionary for managing headers or routes.


Notes:
------
- The server create daemon threads for client handling.
- The current implementation error handling is minimal, socket errors are printed to the console.
- The actual request processing is delegated to the HttpAdapter class.

Usage Example:
--------------
>>> create_backend("127.0.0.1", 9000, routes={})
