daemon.proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module implements a simple proxy server using Python's socket and threading libraries.
It routes incoming HTTP requests to backend services based on hostname mappings and returns
the corresponding responses to clients.

Requirement:
-----------------
- socket: provides socket networking interface.
- threading: enables concurrent client handling via threads.
- response: customized :class: `Response <Response>` utilities.
- httpadapter: :class: `HttpAdapter <HttpAdapter >` adapter for HTTP request processing.
- dictionary: :class: `CaseInsensitiveDict <CaseInsensitiveDict>` for managing headers and cookies.
